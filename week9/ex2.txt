Consider file my_input_dec.txt and my_input_inc.txt, let us take number of frames to be equal 3

In my_input_inc.txt, hit rate is 60%, 2 pages are referenced regularly, and other 
two are referenced seldomly, so the regularly used pages are not removed from page 
frames, and only seldomly used pages are swapped, which results in high hit ratio.

In my_input_dec.txt, hit rate is 0%, all 4 pages are referenced regularly, and it 
happens so that every next referenced page gets placed in frame where another 
regularly used page is placed, which results in many swaps.
